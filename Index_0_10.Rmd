Step 1: Impact Assessment Matrix
Rate expected impact of each intervention (1-10 scale)
*10 = Very high impact, 5 = Moderate impact, 1 = No impact*

```{r}
# Load the transposed matrix
unified_matrix <- read_csv("data/interventions_0_10.csv")

# Extract objective weights and category definitions
objective_weights <- unified_matrix %>%
  filter(type == "score") %>%
  select(objective, category, weight)

# Extract intervention scores
score_matrix <- unified_matrix %>%
  filter(type == "score") %>%
  select(-type, -category, -weight)

# Calculate weighted scores 
results <- score_matrix %>%
  pivot_longer(cols = -objective, names_to = "intervention", values_to = "score") %>%
  left_join(objective_weights, by = "objective") %>%  # join by objective
  # group_by(category) %>%
  # mutate(weight_normalized = weight / sum(weight)) %>%
  # ungroup() %>%
  mutate(weighted_score = score * weight/100) %>% 
  group_by(intervention, category) %>%
  summarise(
    category_score = sum(weighted_score),
    .groups = "drop"
  ) %>%
  pivot_wider(names_from = category, values_from = category_score) %>%
  mutate(total_score = impact + feasibility) %>%
  arrange(desc(total_score))

# Prepare data for heatmap
full_heatmap_data <- unified_matrix %>%
  mutate(label = case_when(
    type == "weight" ~ "PRIORITY WEIGHTS",
    type == "score" ~ objective
  ))

intervention_cols <- setdiff(names(full_heatmap_data), 
                         c("type", "objective", "category", "label"))

full_heatmap_data <- full_heatmap_data %>%
  select(label, all_of(intervention_cols)) %>%
  pivot_longer(cols = -label, names_to = "intervention", values_to = "score") %>%
  mutate(score_display = ifelse(label == "PRIORITY WEIGHTS", score, score))
```


Comprehensive Impact Matrix Heatmap

This shows the complete assessment - both the stakeholder priorities (weights) and intervention impacts.


```{r}
# Filter out the priority weights row for the heatmap
heatmap_display_data <- full_heatmap_data %>%
  filter(label != "PRIORITY WEIGHTS") 

ggplot(heatmap_display_data, aes(x = intervention, y = label, fill = score_display)) +
  geom_tile(color = "white", size = 1) +
  geom_text(aes(label = round(score_display, 1)), color = "black", size = 4) +
  scale_fill_gradient2(low = "white", high = "green", 
                      midpoint = 5, name = "Score") +
  labs(title = "Intervention Impact Matrix",
       subtitle = "Scores show expected impact (1-10) on each objective",

        plot.title = element_text(face = "bold"),

# Bubble Chart - "Impact vs Feasibility (Weighted Composite)"

This chart shows the relationship between impact and feasibility for each intervention option, with a weighted composite average score for each. Bubble size represents the total weighted composite score.

```{r bubble_graph}

# Clean intervention names for display
results <- results %>%
