## Impact Assessment 

Interventions and objectives were identified through expert consultation with *xyz*. The impact assessment conducted via card-based voting (1=low, 2=medium, 3=high impact). We normalized the responses using Percentage of Maximum Possible (POMP) scoring [@cohen1999pomp] to account for participation rates and enable cross-intervention comparison. This approach aligns with established participatory methods in rural development [@chambers1994participatory] and stakeholder engagement metrics [@reed2009stakeholder]. 

```{r data}
# Load the transposed matrix
# unified_matrix <- read_csv("data/interventions_matrix.csv")
unified_matrix_fonio_all <- read_csv("data/fonio_data/interventions_matrix_all.csv")
total_participants <- 55
high_vote_score <- 3
max_possible_per_intervention <- total_participants * high_vote_score 

normalized_matrix_fonio_all <- unified_matrix_fonio_all %>%
  # For score rows only, normalize across intervention columns
  mutate(across(5:13, # the rows that are vote scores
                ~ ifelse(type == "score", 
                        (.x / max_possible_per_intervention) * 10,  # Convert to 1-10 scale
                        .x)))  # Keep weight rows as-is

unified_matrix_fonio_men_boukoumbe <- read_csv("data/fonio_data/interventions_matrix_men_boukoumbe.csv")

unified_matrix_fonio_men_natitingou <- read_csv("data/fonio_data/interventions_matrix_men_natitingou.csv")

unified_matrix_fonio_women_boukoumbe <- read_csv("data/fonio_data/interventions_matrix_women_boukoumbe.csv")

unified_matrix_fonio_women_natitingou <- read_csv("data/fonio_data/interventions_matrix_women_natitingou.csv")

unified_matrix = normalized_matrix_fonio_all

# Scores were done with 1-3 votes - people who did not vote could have indicated that they are a '0' no confidence, or a 'na' that they either did not understand or did not agree. So that the total score could potentially range from n to n*3 participants.

Comprehensive Impact Matrix Heatmap

This shows the complete assessment - both the stakeholder priorities (weights) and intervention impacts.

# Bubble Chart - "Impact vs Feasibility (Weighted Composite)"

This chart shows the relationship between impact and feasibility for each intervention option, with a weighted composite average score for each. Bubble size represents the total weighted composite score.

```{r bubble_graph, echo=FALSE}

# Clean intervention names for display
results <- results %>%
  mutate(intervention_clean = str_replace_all(intervention, "_", " "))

# Use ggrepel

xmin <- min(results$feasibility)
xmax <- max(results$feasibility)
ymin <- min(results$impact)
ymax <- max(results$impact)

ggplot(results, aes(x = feasibility, y = impact, size = total_score)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.7, color = "steelblue") +
  geom_text_repel(aes(label = intervention_clean), size = 3, max.overlaps = 20) +
  # # ADD strategic quadrant labels
  # annotate("text", x = 18, y = 2, label = "Easy Wins", color = "red", fontface = "bold") +
  # annotate("text", x = 18, y = 18, label = "Strategic Priorities", color = "darkgreen", fontface = "bold") +
  # annotate("text", x = 2, y = 18, label = "High Effort", color = "orange", fontface = "bold") +
  # annotate("text", x = 2, y = 2, label = "Avoid", color = "grey", fontface = "bold") +
